Aislander is intended to automate a task we all spend too much time on: manually creating a grocery list. This project takes into account that we meal plan differently than we shop.  By considering various permutations of how a user might interface with their data, this app creates a planning interface and a shopping plan where the priority is efficiency in the store. 

### Technologies

* Backend: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
* Frontend: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, Jinja2, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap
* API: Spoonacular API

### Features
* Users can create grocery lists, and access previously saved ones.
* A user can also search for recipes, and append those recipes' ingredients into one grocery list with a single click of a button.
* The grocery list is organized by aisle categories, saving users from scavenger hunting in grocery stores.
* Users can also bookmark recipes, which can be accessed in their profile page, and create many grocery lists, intended for meal planning purposes.

### About the Author

Charlotte is currently a software engineering fellow at Hackbright Academy. Previously, she graduated from nursing school at USF, ultimately obtaining her RN license in September, 2016. During the program, she acquired 3 years of hands-on nursing experience in prestigious hospitals such as UCSF and Stanford, doing 12-hour shifts in specialties such as labor and delivery, ICU, and pediatrics. While she still believes nursing is one of the noblest professions, her transition to computer programming stems from her itch to become a "modern inventor". The ability to unlock human potential through automation and the never-ending learning embedded in this industry perfectly align with her aspirations.
