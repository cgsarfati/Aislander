Aislander is intended to automate a task we all spend too much time on: manually creating a grocery list. This project takes into account that we meal plan differently than we shop.  By considering various permutations of how a user might interface with their data, this app creates a planning interface and a shopping plan where the priority is efficiency in the store.

Hi! I'm [Charlotte Sarfati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgsarfati/), a software engineer who graduated from Hackbright Academy on September 2017.

Previously, I pursued an undergraduate Nursing degree at USF, ultimately obtaining my RN license in September, 2016. During the program, I acquired 3 years of hands-on nursing experience in hospitals such as UCSF and Stanford, doing 12-hour shifts in specialties such as labor and delivery, ICU, and pediatrics. 

While I still believe nursing is one of the noblest professions, my transition to computer programming stems from my itch to become a "modern inventor". The ability to unlock human potential through automation and the never-ending learning embedded in this industry perfectly align with my aspirations.

I'm currently seeking a full-time software developer role in the San Francisco Bay Area. Feel free to reach out to me to say hi at sarfati.charlotte@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgsarfati/)!
